# Dog Party JS Edition

This is a comp for a dog party website. I used [this comp](http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/dog-party-js-edition.jpg) to create my own static site. The objective was to mimic the comp as closely as possible whithout worrying about creating actual buttons or links (aside from the submit form).

Here is a screen grab of my ![final site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Users/rumizen/turing/mod_1/dog-party/images/dog-party-screenshot.jpg)
